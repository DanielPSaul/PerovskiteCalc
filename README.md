**Description:** With this simple perovskite solar panel project cost calculator, users enter location and various levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) inputs such as total installation cost, discount rate, and annual panel energy generated. Then, a basic table and visualizations, which are downloadable, are outputted with the overall calculated LCOE compared to local commercial, industrial, and residential eletricity prices offered by the local power company. Users can also select to enter an LCOE value they already have and simply compare to the electricity rates. This project is one of the apps developled during my student assistantship with the Terry College of Business - Management Information Systems and Physics department at the University of Georgia. Specifically, requirements were gathered from the Physics Department at UGA for perovskite solar cells they are developing.
